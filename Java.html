 These are the basics of Java script and basic commands and rules for Java script and Java script can be very confusing so there is a lot of comments
Explaining how things work. Java can be used for many concepts and just to make a website work properly Java is most of the systems and how things work on websites and how 
you interact with the site and use it or simple things like just showing your answer on a math site.the Basic systems  and commands of Java and show off how things like for loops and if commands and arrays which are all ways to 
  help you make a interesting website and have it function for loops can loop if statments allow for things to react and arrays are like a list of sorts. There are also concepts of
  Internal and external with external being outside of a command and internal being the contents and head being the start of whatever you put it on and footer being at the end of 
  commands or paragraphs. There is also things like script tags those are used so that they can be placed in HTML code without needing to use an external Java sheet or commands 
  like Alerts which are shown directly to anyone when they click on the site and console.log which shows things in the console and the only way to see it is in the console.
